Using what you've learned in this lab, do the following:

- Create a new user named `inosuke`. Set the password as `alta3`

- Inosuke is a temp we hired and won't be with us at the end of the month, so please set the account to EXPIRE 30 days from now.

- Also, make sure that when the account goes inactive the password is inactive as well.

- Check `/etc/passwd` to confirm that the user was created correctly!
