## Complete Lab 5. POSIX File System

<img src="https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/46085820/in-the-man-pages-the-answer-you-will-find.jpg" width="300"/>

A man page (short for *manual*) exists for virtually every term and concept in Linux, and it can all be accessed without ever leaving your command line! That said, there's not a Linux user born who doesn't also make heavy use of Google!

Use the `man <search term>` command to look up some of the terms mentioned in this lab. Some suggested topics are:

- sudo
- su
- bash

Even once you find the appropriate man page, they still might not be super helpful-- we are NEW to this, after all! Ask your friendly neighborhood instructor for clarification when you need it!
