It's a deep, dense world of files and directories in Linux, and you'll definitely need to know how to `find` your way!

Paste the following command into your terminal:

`student@bchd:~$` `cd && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csfeeser/Linux-Exercises/main/findingfiles.py -qO findingfiles.py && sudo python3 findingfiles.py`

Mischief managed! With your new `find` command, accomplish the following:

- Find where a file named `SLAPPY` is located. 
- Find and remove all files that end in `.horgledorgle`
> Don’t try to hunt them all down individually-- use Google to find a solution!
