Run the following command:

`student@bchd:~$` `cd && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csfeeser/Linux-Exercises/main/essentialtools.sh`

As we finish up our work with Linux today, do the following to test the most recent commands you've learned:

- Rename the file `stuck.txt` to `haha_youre_stuck.txt` and move it the the `/home/student/static` directory.
- Get rid of all files in `/home/student/` named `file#.txt`
- Get rid of the nested directory `/trash/dirs/clog/things/up` in your `/home/student` directory.
- Use the `ls` command to see what other files you've created today. Delete all files that end in `*.sh`, you won't be needing them moving forward.
