Take the code written here- it's busted! Can you make the necessary changes so that this script will work?

Create a file named `day2warmup.py`

```python
#!/usr/env python3

def main():
    pi= 3.14
    c= circumference
    r= radius

    print("To calculate the " + c + " of a circle, the formula is 2 x " + pi + " x " + " r " )
    # OUTPUT SHOULD READ AS:
    # To calculate the circumference of a circle, the formula is 2 x 3.14 x radius

```

In your terminal, run these commands to execute the code:

`chmod u+x day2warmup.py`

`./day2warmup.py`
