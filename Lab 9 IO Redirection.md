## Complete Lab 9. I/O Redirection

I/O redirection is something that will translate into many Python labs we will be completing in the days to come. It's another one of those vital Linux skills that everyone should possess!

Here is a quick challenge. Run the following command:

`student@bchd:~$` `cd && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csfeeser/Linux-Exercises/main/catfiles.sh -qO catfiles.sh && bash catfiles.sh`

Change directories into the new directory you just made.

`student@bchd:~$` `cd ~/haiku`

Inside this directory you will find three files. Your task is to use the `cat` command to reveal the contents of each file. Use what you've learned in lab 9 to combine the contents of these three files into a single new file `completed.txt`. The content of `completed.txt` when finished should be thus:

```
Haikus are easy.
But sometimes they don't make sense.
Refrigerator.
```
